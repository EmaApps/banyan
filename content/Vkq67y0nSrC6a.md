Brilliant idea. VSCode extensions are like mini-apps in themselves. VSCode exposes their 'callbacks' via app URIs, which can be linked to from HTML pages. I wrote a VSCode extension for Banayan that accepts two invocations:

- Edit parent
- New node (under another parent)

This takes care the rest of the Ema workflow for me -- creating new nodes under an existing parent, and editing nodes. Good enough for now.
