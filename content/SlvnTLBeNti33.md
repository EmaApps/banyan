# Folding

The idea behind "folding" is this. Over time, the *stream of thoughts* may grow *unboundedly*. In future, these streams are often a nuissance -- as they would just be long lists of thought dump with no summarizing element to it. What we need here is *insights*, as gleaned from these streams over time. Hence, "folding" - as if a lengthy stream is "folded" to represent more permanent **nuggets** of information that can be consulted often.

How can Bayan facilitate this model?

- When we summarize a stream, the summary should replace the stream, while still leaving the stream in place (hidden) and linked.
