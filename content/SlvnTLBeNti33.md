# Folding

The idea is "folding" is this. Over time, the *stream of thoughts* may ground unboundedly. In future, these streams are often a nuissance. What we need here is *insights*, as gleaned from these streams overtime. Hence, "folding" - as if the a lengthy stream is "folded" to represent more permanent nuggets of information that can be consulted often.

How can Bayan facilitate this model?
