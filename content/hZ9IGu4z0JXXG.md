# Markdown Demo

[Commonmark](https://commonmark.org/) should work with the usual extensions.

## Headings

You can have sub-headings and more.

### Sub-heading

This works too.

## Inline styling

You can *italic*, **bold**, or `monospace`.

## Block styling

> Blockquotes work.

Code blocks too:

```haskell
module Main where
main = print 42
```
