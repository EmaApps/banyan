There are two ways to deploy Banyon sites: 
- GitHub Pages (statically) ... or
- run the 'live server' in a VPS with Syncthing doing the sync. 

The latter is interesting for quick updates, but former is rather lightweight to maintain multiple sites without worrying about deployment and maintenance (not to mention security).
