# banyan

WIP: Tree of time. 

Like [Wind of Change](https://windofchange.me), but using the tree model, and as a static site -- so there is no social aspect, for which you should still use WOC. I probably will begin using banyan primarily, and then cross-post its content to WOC for enabling discussions.

Fun facts:

- banyan is the first project to use Emanote [as a library](https://github.com/srid/banyan/commit/869991888349190855b3c963493f9ff352d250d0), so as to provide an Emanote-like experience without being tied to its specific domain area (Zettelkasten, notebook, wiki).
